select * from NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS where parameter='NLS_CHARACTERSET';

db_name is optional. The character set name should be specified without quotes. For example:

ALTER DATABASE CHARACTER SET AL32UTF8;

To change the database character set, perform the following steps:

Shut down the database, using either a SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE or a SHUTDOWN NORMAL statement.
Do a full backup of the database because the ALTER DATABASE CHARACTER SET statement cannot be rolled back.
Complete the following statements:
STARTUP MOUNT;
ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE RESTRICTED SESSION;
ALTER SYSTEM SET JOB_QUEUE_PROCESSES=0;
ALTER SYSTEM SET AQ_TM_PROCESSES=0;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
ALTER DATABASE CHARACTER SET new_character_set;
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE; -- or SHUTDOWN NORMAL; 
STARTUP;
